/**
 * LevelConfig holds all the tunable numbers that change from level to level.
 *
 * The game loop calls LevelConfig.forLevel(level) once at the start of each
 * level and then reads the four fields below.  Your job is to edit forLevel()
 * so the game gets harder as the level number rises.
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * FIELD GUIDE — what each field does and how to tune it
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * ghostSpeedMultiplier
 *   Multiplied against every ghost's base movement speed.
 *   1.0  = normal speed (good for level 1)
 *   1.5  = 50 % faster  (challenging)
 *   2.0  = double speed  (very hard — use with care)
 *   Tip: small increases feel big in practice; try 0.05–0.10 per level.
 *
 * frightenDuration
 *   How many seconds ghosts stay blue after the player eats a power pellet.
 *   6.0  = generous (easy to chase down ghosts)
 *   2.0  = tight window (hard to eat them before they recover)
 *   0.0  = power pellets give no blue time at all (extreme)
 *   Tip: reduce by ~0.5 s per level; clamp to 0 so it never goes negative.
 *
 * spawnDelay
 *   Seconds between each ghost leaving the ghost house at level start.
 *   3.0  = ghosts trickle out slowly (easy opening)
 *   1.0  = ghosts pour out quickly (less breathing room)
 *   0.0  = all ghosts start outside immediately
 *   Tip: reducing this makes the very start of a level more dangerous.
 *
 * bonusThreshold
 *   The player must eat this many regular dots before a BonusItem appears.
 *   70   = bonus item appears roughly mid-level
 *   30   = appears early (more bonus chances)
 *   120  = appears late or possibly never on small boards
 *   Tip: keep it between 30 and 120 for a typical Pac-Man board.
